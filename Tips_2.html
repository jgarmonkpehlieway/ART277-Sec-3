<h2>"Fully Vaccinated" doesn't mean "immune to COVID-19"</h2>
<p>
  As restrictions and masks mandates are dropped around the country, people who are fully vaccinated might be feeling the return to-do-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn't the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent there still a chance that you could become infected.
  <br /><br />
  Dr. Cardona explaines.
</p>
<p>
  "Full Vaccinated" means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-COV-2 virus"
</p>
<h3>Can fully Vaccinated People still transmit the virus to others, including others vaccinated people?</h3>
<p>
  While it is still possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don't have a good immune response to vaccines.
</p>
<p>
  "The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorder may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine response in these vulnerable population.
